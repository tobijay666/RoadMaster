# RoadMaster - PUSL2020 Project


## Overview

The PUSL2020 project was conceived as part of a university assignment during the second year. Developed with a focus on web technologies, the project utilizes a stack consisting of HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP. The backend is powered by a MySQL database, and an illustrative example of its structure is provided in the `database.sql` file.

### Development Structure

While the project acknowledges a lack of a formalized development architecture, it successfully achieves 100% functionality. The primary emphasis has been on delivering a working solution within the academic context.

## Concept

The project revolves around a collaborative effort involving the Road Development Authority (RDA) of Sri Lanka, the Sri Lankan Police, and Insurance Companies. The objective is to launch a website that facilitates the tracking of traffic accidents, allowing drivers to report incidents while enabling the RDA/Police to provide necessary support.

### Key Features

- **User Registration**: Vehicle owners or drivers can register on the system using their vehicle registration numbers and insurance details.

- **Accident Reporting**: In the event of an accident, drivers can report incidents through the website, accompanied by supporting photos.

- **Review and Validation**: RDA staff, Police, and relevant insurance companies have access to view all reported incidents. They can validate these incidents by examining uploaded photos and take necessary actions, such as approving or rejecting claims.

- **Statistical Analysis**: The Police can utilize different graphical representations, powered by `chart.js`, to analyze approved accidents. This includes percentages of accidents involving bikes, cars, buses, and insights into the causes of accidents.

### Technologies Used

The project leverages the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JS
- **Backend**: PHP
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Charting**: chart.js

## Conclusion

While the PUSL2020 project may lack a formal development architecture, its successful implementation and 100% functional status underscore its effectiveness in achieving the outlined objectives. The collaborative platform aims to enhance the management and analysis of traffic incidents, offering a valuable tool for various stakeholders in Sri Lanka's road development and safety landscape.
